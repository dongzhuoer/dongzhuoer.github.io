# redirect

I'm not certain whether I will keep my personal website at `dongzhuoer.com` or `zhuoer.netlify.com` even for the next year. But one thing is for sure, I will never leave GitHub, and my username will fixed at `dongzhuoer`, unless something really serious happens. It's such a pity that `zhuoer` has already been used by an organization. After struggling for several months, I got comfortable with `dongzhuoer`. And the burden to change it is getting larger and larger.

So I choose to use This repo 

Therefore, for some permanent links, I decide to use the form of `https://dongzhuoer.github.io/_redirects/*` and redirect it to `https://dongzhuoer.com/*` or somewhere else.
