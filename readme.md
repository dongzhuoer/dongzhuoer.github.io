# cause

I'm not certain whether I will keep my personal website at `dongzhuoer.com` or `zhuoer.netlify.com` even for the next year. But one thing is for sure, I will never leave GitHub, and my username will fixed at `dongzhuoer`. (It's such a pity that `zhuoer` has already been used by an organization. After struggling for several months, I got comfortable with `dongzhuoer`. And the burden to change it is getting larger and larger.)



# present

So I decide to use `dongzhuoer.github.io` as domain of my personal website. 

The actual code reside in https://github.com/dongzhuoer/homesite, and this repo only serves redirecting to `dongzhuoer.com`.



# future

I may want to maintain some permanent links, like https://dongzhuoer.github.io/foobar` and redirect it to `https://dongzhuoer.com/*` or somewhere else.
